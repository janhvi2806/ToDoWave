## Motive
In todayâ€™s world of recession and uncertain economy following the pandemic, it is vital to have healthy and sustainable financing no matter who you are. A big part in ensuring this is to stay clear of risky loan traps and prevent taking on unsustainable debts. A smart individual would diligently measure the amount and purpose of each loan against their own specific information to determine their ability to pay the loan back. There is certainly a large scope for programs and algorithms that can help in making this decision with high accuracy.
